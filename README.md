# JWT Implementation Backup

This branch (`jwt-login-backup`) contains a backup of the JWT (JSON Web Token) implementation for the Spring Boot project. This implementation includes all necessary components for JWT authentication and authorization.

## Purpose

The purpose of this branch is to provide a backup of the JWT implementation, so it can be easily restored or reused in the future without having to reimplement JWT functionality from scratch.

## Key Components

The JWT implementation in this branch includes the following components:

1. **JwtUtil.java**
   - Utility class for generating and validating JWT tokens.

2. **MyUserDetailsService.java**
   - Custom `UserDetailsService` implementation to load user-specific data.

3. **MyUserDetails.java**
   - Implementation of the `UserDetails` interface to represent user details.

4. **JwtRequestFilter.java**
   - Custom filter to validate JWT tokens on each request.

5. **SecurityConfig.java**
   - Spring Security configuration class to set up JWT authentication and authorization.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Ensure Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have the necessary dependencies in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` for JWT and Spring Security.

2. **Configure Spring Boot Application:**
   Ensure that your Spring Boot application is configured to use the components in this branch. This typically involves configuring Spring Security and updating your application properties.

3. **Integrate JWT Utilities:**
   - Update your application to use the JWT utilities and filters provided in this branch.
   - Ensure your authentication endpoints generate and validate JWT tokens as required.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test your application to ensure that JWT authentication and authorization work correctly with the provided components.

## Usage

- **Generating Tokens:**
  Use `JwtUtil` to generate JWT tokens during authentication.

- **Validating Tokens:**
  Use `JwtRequestFilter` to validate tokens on each request.

- **Loading User Details:**
  Use `MyUserDetailsService` to load user-specific data based on the JWT token.

## Notes

- This branch serves as a backup of the JWT implementation. For further development or integration, you may need to merge changes with other branches or update configurations as needed.
- Ensure that sensitive information such as secret keys used for JWT signing are properly secured and not hardcoded in the codebase.
